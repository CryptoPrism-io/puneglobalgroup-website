**Angle:** Straight top-down (directly above)
**Show:**
- Full tray filling the frame
- All grid cells clearly visible

**Angle:** 3/4 front, slightly above
**Show:**
- Interior grid visible
- Tray walls
- One corner clearly showing rivet and cut edge
**Notes:** If you have an automotive part (metal bracket, small component), place 2-3 inside cells for context.

---

### 5. `pp-sheets-stack.jpg`
**Product:** Stack of 8-10 PP corrugated flat sheets
**Angle:** Side profile, 15° tilt from straight-on
**Show:**
- THE CUT EDGE IS THE HERO — each sheet's edge must show the hollow rectangular flute channels clearly

**Angle:** 45° fan spread
**Show:**

## Quick Tips

| Issue | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| Shadows too harsh | Move product further from light source / use white reflector opposite |
| Background not clean | Tape 2 sheets of A1 white chart paper, overlap slightly |
| Cut edge not visible | Turn product so edge faces camera + direct a small torch at edge |
| Plastic looks dull | Wipe surface with dry microfibre cloth before shooting |
| Phone camera | Use rear camera, tap to focus on the edge/label, portrait mode OFF |

## FBB (Folding Box Board) Shots

FBB is a multi-ply paperboard — white coated top, cream/grey back. Used for premium packaging.
**Background:** White seamless. **Lighting:** Raking side light to show surface texture and coating gloss.

| # | Filename | Product | Angle | Key thing to show |
|---|----------|---------|-------|-------------------|
| 13 | `fbb-reel.jpg` | FBB paper reel (large roll, 1-2m wide) | Front 3/4, standing back 3m | Full reel height, paper layers on edge visible, any ITC/TNPL label on core |
| 14 | `fbb-reel-side.jpg` | Same FBB reel | Side profile | Layers of coated board visible on the cross-section edge, white coated outer |
| 15 | `fbb-sheets-stack.jpg` | Stack of cut FBB sheets | Side profile 15° tilt | Clean cut edge showing the multi-ply layers (white coat / clay / pulp / back coat), slight fan spread |
| 16 | `fbb-sheets-topdown.jpg` | Single FBB sheet or small stack | Top-down flat lay | White coated surface, slight gloss sheen, any brand watermark visible |
| 17 | `fbb-cutting-machine.jpg` | FBB sheet cutting/sheeting machine in operation | Wide shot from side | Machine + FBB sheets being cut, factory setting |
| 18 | `fbb-cut-size.jpg` | Cut-to-size FBB sheet stacks, multiple sizes | 3/4 angle | Several stacks of different sizes showing the converting/sheeting output |
| 19 | `fbb-grade-samples.jpg` | Multiple FBB grade samples side by side | Top-down flat lay | ITC Cyber Oak, TNPL, imported grades — label each with a small card if possible |

### FBB Quick Notes
- The **white coated surface** and **multi-ply cut edge** are the hero details — get those sharp
- Reel shots: if reels are stored horizontally (lying down), shoot from the side showing the spiral layers
- If you have ITC / TNPL branded packaging/wrappers on the reels, keep them visible — adds credibility
- Cut edge of FBB sheet should show distinct layers: white clay coat → pulp → back grey — this is what makes FBB different from regular paper
